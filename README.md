# Retail Revenue Intelligence – SQL Analysis

This repository contains SQL queries used to analyze revenue performance, discount dependency, and growth trends for a retail business.  
The analysis supports an interactive Power BI dashboard that answers the business question:

**“Is revenue growth organic, or is it primarily driven by heavy discounting?”**

The SQL scripts are organized by analytical theme and were used to generate insights for:
- Executive performance overview
- Revenue leakage analysis
- Growth intelligence and trend evaluation
